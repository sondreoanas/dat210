step 1
	Do the thing you want to record.
step 2
	Run the function "mf_testHandeler.getRecord()" in the console.
step 3
	Copy-paste the list into "mf_testerData.js". Replace the list that is already there. This file should only contain one list.
step 4
	Refresh page and set the state  of the page to what it was before the recording started. Run "mf_testHandeler.start()" in the console.
	This should start the test.
	When the test finishes is is successful, if not, it fails. Success/fail message will display in console.
	"mf_testHandeler.start()" also has two optional agruments. "mf_testHandeler.start(acceleration, noiseFactor)".
	By deafault theese are 10 and 0. The acceleration says how fast the test will run,
	while the noiseFactor says if there should be noise added to the controls.
